What is EXPORT DEFAULT Keyword?
The export default keywords specify the main component in the file
What is State?
Data that changes over time is called state.

handleSubmit : It is event handler ie only called when event is fired and not during compile time
handleSubmit : It is directly called during complie time without firing any event

{} : Anything written between {} is executed directly (At compile time)
If we want anything to be executed only during event fire time either we should wrap with anonnymous function ()=>{}
or with any relevant function name hello(){} or hello()=>{}
